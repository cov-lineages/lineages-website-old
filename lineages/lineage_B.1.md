| Lineage | Notes |
|:-----|:-----|
| B.1 | A large European lineage that corresponds to the Italian outbreak. |
| B.1.1 | New European lineage that's been assigned due to high support and 3 clear SNPs `28881GA`,`28882GA`,`28883GC`. Note: Sub-lineages that previously existed within this lineage have been reassigned a new lineage name. |
| B.1.1.1 | Formerly B.1.1, UK/ Europe (BS=80) |
| B.1.1.10 | Formerly B.1.10, UK/ Iceland (BS lower this week 70 -> 11), a lot of diversity in this lineage, now has a Turkish sequence.  |
| B.1.1.13 | Formerly B.1.61, UK lineage (BS=95) |
| B.1.1.14 | Formerly B.1.60, Scottish lineage (BS=89) |
| B.1.1.17 | Formerly B.1.58, Iceland lineage (BS=100) |

| B.1.1.p12 | Formerly B.1.49, Scottish lineage (BS=48) |
| B.1.1.p15 | Formerly B.1.46, Luxembourg (BS=11, but internal nodes all 100 and all Luxembourg) |
| B.1.1.p16 | Formerly B.1.59, Wales lineage (BS=70) |
| B.1.1.p19 | Formerly B.1.45, Australian lineage (BS=91) |
| B.1.12 | BeNeLux (BS=18 this week, lots of internal 100) |
| B.1.13 | England/ Australia, may need refining parent node BS=59, internal node of 100 |
| B.1.19 | USA (BS=100) |

| B.1.49 | Scotland (BS=92) |
| B.1.5 | England/ Spain/ Turkey/ Australia/ USA/ Brasil. Low support at parent node now, potentially as a result of homoplasies (BS=5) |
| B.1.5.1 | Iceland (BS=27), but all sequences suggest an Icelandic lineage |
| B.1.5.2 | Netherlands (BS=100) |
| B.1.5.3 | England (now containing an Australian & Swedish seqeuence) (BS=96) |

| B.1.72 | UK lineage (BRIS) (BS=100) |
| B.1.8 | Netherlands/ Europe (BS=47) |
| B.1.p11 | UK lineage but low support and splitting up, pruned down quite a lot, but may need to be removed next time (BS=31) |
| B.1.p16 | Belgium, low support (BS=19), keep an eye on this with new data  |
| B.1.p2 | USA (low BS=9) |
| B.1.p21 | Washington (USA) (Low BS=9) |
| B.1.p25 | Australian lineage, some low internal bootstrap values and parent node BS=16. However all sequences within it are Australian and that's with quite a lot of diversity as well. |
| B.1.p42 | Sweden/ Denmark lineage, split up in the tree this week |
| B.1.p68 | USA lineage (UT) (BS=100) |
| B.1.p73 | Scotland lineage (BS=5, so very low) |
