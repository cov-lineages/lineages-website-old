<h3>Lineage descriptions</h3>

| Lineage | Notes |
|:-----|:-----|
| <a href="{{ 'lineages/lineage_A.html' | absolute_url }}">A</a> | Root of the pandemic lies within lineage A. Many sequences originating from China and many global exports; including to South East Asia, Japan, South Korea, Australia, the USA and Europe, represented in this lineage |
| <a href="{{ 'lineages/lineage_A.1.html' | absolute_url }}">A.1</a> | A North American lineage (BS=16) |
| <a href="{{ 'lineages/lineage_A.1.1.html' | absolute_url }}">A.1.1</a> | Iceland lineage (BS=94) |
| <a href="{{ 'lineages/lineage_A.1.3.html' | absolute_url }}">A.1.3</a> | Previously Australian lineage, structure has split up into the diverity of A.1, so all reassigned A.1 |
| <a href="{{ 'lineages/lineage_A.2.html' | absolute_url }}">A.2</a> | Majoritively Spanish lineage now with a variety of other locations represented, including South and Central American sequences, other European countries and Kazakhstan.  |
| <a href="{{ 'lineages/lineage_A.2.1.html' | absolute_url }}">A.2.1</a> | Lineage with sequences predominantly from Panama |
| <a href="{{ 'lineages/lineage_A.2.2.html' | absolute_url }}">A.2.2</a> | Australian lineage nested within the diversity of A.2 |
| <a href="{{ 'lineages/lineage_A.2.3.html' | absolute_url }}">A.2.3</a> | Scottish lineage nested within the diversity of A.2 |
| <a href="{{ 'lineages/lineage_A.3.html' | absolute_url }}">A.3</a> | USA and Australian lineage  |
| <a href="{{ 'lineages/lineage_A.4.html' | absolute_url }}">A.4</a> | USA lineage nested in A diveristy |
| <a href="{{ 'lineages/lineage_A.5.html' | absolute_url }}">A.5</a> | A lineage with a lot of representation from Spanish-speaking countries. A Spanish/ South-American lineage, but now with sequences from an outbreak in Scotland |
| <a href="{{ 'lineages/lineage_A.6.html' | absolute_url }}">A.6</a> | Lineage from an introduction event into Thailand, now including a couple of exports |
| <a href="{{ 'lineages/lineage_A.7.html' | absolute_url }}">A.7</a> | Indian lineage, including Saudi Arabian & Turkish sequences. A.7, A.8 and A.9 are all lineages with diversity from India, however are difficult to resolve confidently, potentially due to ambiguities or homoplasies in the sequences. All are nested within the diversity of A. |
| <a href="{{ 'lineages/lineage_A.8.html' | absolute_url }}">A.8</a> | Merged with sister Indian lineage A.7. A.7, A.8 and A.9 are all lineages with diversity from India, however are difficult to resolve confidently, potentially due to ambiguities or homoplasies in the sequences. All are nested within the diversity of A. |
| <a href="{{ 'lineages/lineage_A.9.html' | absolute_url }}">A.9</a> | Indian lineage. A.7, A.8 and A.9 are all lineages with diversity from India, however are difficult to resolve confidently, potentially due to ambiguities or homoplasies in the sequences.
