<h2>Lineage descriptions</h2>

| Lineage | Notes |
|:-----|:-----|
| A | Root of the pandemic lies within lineage A. Many sequences originating from China and many global exports; including to South East Asia, Japan, South Korea, Australia, the USA and Europe, represented in this lineage |
| A.1 | A North American lineage, with some sequences from Australia in (BS=95) |
| A.1.1 | Iceland lineage (BS:100->79) |
| A.1.3 | Australian lineage (BS=100) |
| A.2 | Spain/ Chile/ Australia/ Europe (BS=93) |
| A.3 | USA and Australian lineage (BS: 100 -> 44). Low BS likely due to India/NCDC-3279/2020, which was misassigned and likely jumps around the tree. |
| A.4 | Lineage circulating in USA (all sequences Wisconsin) (BS=100) |
| A.5 | A lineage with a lot of representation from Spanish-speaking countries. A majoritively Spain/ South-American lineage, lower bootstrap this week BS 87->20.  |
| A.6 | Lineage in Thailand (BS=87) |
| A.p7 | Potential lineage: Saudi Arabia, Russia, Turkey, India (BS=50) |
