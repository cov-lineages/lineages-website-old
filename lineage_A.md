title: Lineage A

<p>Root of the pandemic lies within lineage A. Many sequences originating from China and many global exports; including to South East Asia, Japan, South Korea, Australia, the USA and Europe, represented in this lineage</p>

<ul class="alt">
    <li> <h3>A.1</h3>A North American lineage, with some sequences from Australia in (BS=95)</li>
    <li> <h3>A.1.1</h3>Iceland lineage (BS:100->79)</li>
    <li> <h3>A.1.3</h3>Australian lineage (BS=100)</li>
    <li> <h3>A.2</h3>Spain/ Chile/ Australia/ Europe (BS=93)</li>
    <li> <h3>A.3</h3>USA and Australian lineage (BS: 100 -> 44). Low BS likely due to India/NCDC-3279/2020, which was misassigned and likely jumps around the tree.</li>
    <li> <h3>A.4</h3>Lineage circulating in USA (all sequences Wisconsin) (BS=100)</li>
    <li> <h3>A.5</h3>A lineage with a lot of representation from Spanish-speaking countries. A majoritively Spain/ South-American lineage, lower bootstrap this week BS 87->20.</li>
    <li> <h3>A.6</h3>Lineage in Thailand (BS=87)</li>
    <li> <h3>A.p7</h3>Potential lineage: Saudi Arabia, Russia, Turkey, India (BS=50)</li>
