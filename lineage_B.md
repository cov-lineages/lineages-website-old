title: Lineage B
---

<p>Root of the pandemic lies within lineage A. Many sequences originating from China and many global exports; including to South East Asia, Japan, South Korea, Australia, the USA and Europe, represented in this lineage</p>


| Lineage | Notes |
|:-----|:-----|
| B | Base of this lineage also lies in China, with many global exports, two distinct SNPs `8782TC` and `28144CT` define this lineage |
| B.1 | A large European lineage that corresponds to the Italian outbreak |
| B.1.1 | UK/ Iceland/ Russia |
| B.1.2 | USA/ Australia (low BS=8) |
| B.1.3 | USA/ Argentina (low BS=8) |
| B.1.5 | As more sequences have accumulated, quite a spread out lineage. European. Low support at parent node now (BS=9) |
| B.1.5.1 | Iceland (BS=41), but Epi-data suggests an icelandic lineage |
| B.1.5.2 | Netherlands (BS=100) |
| B.1.5.3 | England (BS=97) |
| B.1.5.4 | Spain (BS=100) |
| B.1.5.5 | England (BS=100) |
| B.1.5.6 | UK/ Netherlands (BS=100) |
| B.1.6 | Belgian lineage (BS=70) |
| *B.1.7 | Low support (BS=9), dissolved into B.1 |
| B.1.8 | Netherlands/ Europe BS=58 |
| B.1.9 | Netherlands/ Belgium/ Turkey (BS=100) |
| B.1.10 | UK/ Iceland (BS=70) |
| B.1.11 | UK lineage but now low support (BS=19) |
| B.1.12 | BeNeLux (BS=63, lots of internal 100) |
| B.1.13 | England/ Australia, may need refining parent node BS=55, internal node of 100 |
| B.1.16 | Belgium, low support (BS=38) |
| B.1.19 | Luxembourg/ USA (BS=66) |
| B.1.21 | Washington (USA) (Low BS=8) |
| B.1.20 | England/ Netherlands Low support (BS=25), will watch for new data |
| B.1.22 | Netherlands (BS=100) |
| B.1.23 | Australia (BS=41) |
| B.1.24 | Wales (BS=100) |
| B.1.25 | All quite low internal bootstrap values and parent node BS=27. However all sequences within it are Australian and that's with quite a lot of diversity as well. Will watch for more data in next weeks release |
| B.1.26 | USA lineage (BS=87) |
| B.1.27 | USA/ Argentina (BS=52) |
| B.1.28 | Denmark / USA Parent BS=12, internal nodes BS all 100 |
| B.1.29 | USA (BS=100) |
| B.1.30 | England (BS=100) |
| B.1.31 | Australia (BS=100) |
| B.1.32 | Swedish lineage (BS=100) |
| B.1.33 | Australian lineage (BS=100) |
| B.1.34 | England (BS=99) |
| B.1.35 | Wales (BS=96) |
| B.1.36 | Turkey/ Saudi Arabia/ Egypt / Finland & England (BS=100) |
| B.1.37 | USA lineage (BS=100) |
| B.1.38 | USA (BS=100) |
| B.1.39 | Denmark (BS=100) |
| B.1.40 | Scotland (BS=92) |
| B.1.41 | USA (BS=89) |
| B.1.42 | Sweden/ Denmark (low BS=11, but convincing Epi-data) |
| B.1.43 | USA (BS=72) |
| B.1.44 | Wales (BS=100) |
| B.1.45 | Australia middling BS=44, but all Australian sequences within a background of European and Asian |
| B.1.46 | Luxembourg (BS=38, but internal nodes all 100 and all Luxembourg) |
| B.1.47 | England (BS=100) |
| B.1.48 | England (BS=39, but all other internal nodes 100, may refine this in next weeks release with more data) |
| B.1.49 | Scotland (BS=92) |
| B.1.50 | Portugal/ Wales (BS=100) |
| B.1.51 | UK (BS=92) |
| B.1.52 | England (BS=100) |
| B.1.53 | England / USA (BS=95) |
| B.1.54 | Iceland/ Belgium/ UK (BS=98) |
| B.1.55 | UK (BS=100) |
| B.1.56 | UK/ Australia/ Iceland (BS=100) |
| B.2 | A previously defined large European/ Australian lineage that with new data has low support (BS=13). This lineage and its sublineage will need to be re-examined and perhaps refined quite significantly in next weeks data |
| B.2.2 | Previously defined UK/ Belgium /USA (BS=20) |
| *B.2.3 | Dissolved into B.2 (No good internal BS, misassignments) |
| B.2.4 | Australian lineage, took a subset of previously defined B.2.4 and reassigning them B.2 |
| B.2.5 | Spain/ England / Australia (BS=29), unique SNPs `23707CT`,`26144GT` |
| B.2.6 | UK/ Australian lineage (BS=100) |
| B.3 | A European lineage, including a large set of sequences from Wales, but new data has given a parent node with BS=8 |
| B.4 | Iran lineage, many sequences we have of this lineage are associated with travel histories from Iran |
| B.5 | Japanese lineage (BS=77). Originally also included USA/CruiseA samples, but they have been reassigned as B lineage due to lower BS=(64) in this weeks ML tree |
| B.6 | India/ Philippines/ UK/ North America/ Australia (BS=100) |
| B.7 | Hong Kong lineage (BS=is 73) |
| B.8 | UK lineage (England and Wales), this week BS=was 27 so slightly problematic, next week's data will shed more light |
| B.9 | Australian/ England lineage (BS=100) |
| B.10 | Northern Ireland/ England (BS=99) |
| B.11 | Netherlands lineage (BS=99) |
