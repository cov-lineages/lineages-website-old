      <p>As more and more labs across the world are contributing to the genomics effort and sequencing SARS-CoV-2 genomes, new lineages continue to be identified. We do regular updates of the lineage scheme, but acknowledge that data is being produced at a rate far faster than we are doing novel data releases!</p>
    <p> If you identify a set of sequences that are likely to be a new lineage, we invite you to submit them to be incorporated into the lineage scheme.</p>
    <p>Follow the below guidelines to submit a new lineage to the scheme.</p>
